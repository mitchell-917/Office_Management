# Office management challenge

## Instructions:
* Challenge time: until the end of the day
* Feel free to use google, your notes, books etc but please work on your own
* Please raise a pull request when you start this challenge, and keep pushing updates as and when you make commits throughout the day
* There is *no expectation* to finish all or any of the user stories, please use this time to reflect on where you feel you are with the skill and what may support your learning.
* If you get blocked, please reflect on what blocked you and any strategies you adopted that helped you make progress.

## Set up:
* Fork the repo to your github repo
* Clone the project from your github repo to your machine
* cd office-management-challenge
* bundle install

## Task:

# As a staff member
In order to have meeting,
I would like to check if the meeting room is available or not (true or false)



# As a staff member
In order to have a meeting,
I would like to be able to enter the meeting room and this should make it unavailable


# As a staff member
In order to end a meeting
I would like to be able to leave the meeting room and this should make it available again



# As a staff member
So that I can avoid interrupting a meeting
I would like an error if I try to use a room that has already been entered



# As a staff member
In order to distinguish between meeting rooms
I would like my meeting room to have a name



As an office manager
So that staff can coordinate meetings
I would like to add a meeting room to the office


```
As an office manager
So that I can manage meeting rooms
I would like to list all the meeting rooms in the office
```

```
As a staff member
So that I can see where to have my meeting
I would like to be able to see a list of available rooms in the office
```

#### Stretch user stories

```
As an office manager
So that I can find out when a room becomes available
I would like to receive a text message whenever a meeting room becomes available again
```

```
As an office manager
So that I can have visibility of how the rooms are being used
I would like to see the name of the meeting and the name of the team that is using the room
```

* Hints on stretch functionality to implement:
* The text sending functionality should be implemented using [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api). You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
* Use the `twilio-ruby` gem to access the API
* Use the `Gemfile` to manage your gems
* Try and make use of mocks and/or stubs so that actual texts don't get sent when your tests are run
* However, if your code is loaded into IRB the text should actually be sent
* Note that you can only send texts in the same country as you have your account. I.e. if you have a UK account you can only send to UK numbers.

> :warning: **WARNING:** think twice before you push your **mobile number** or **Twilio API Key** to a public space like GitHub :eyes:
>
> :key: Now is a great time to think about security and how you can keep your private information secret. You might want to explore environment variables.

### Code Review
In code review we'll be hoping to see:

  * All tests passing
  * High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
  * The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.
  * Commits are regular and scoped
